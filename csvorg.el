Each row in CSVFILE corresponds to one `org-mode' entry in ORGFILE.
The entries are placed at the end of ORGFILE under a newly created
top-level heading TOPHEADING, which defaults to
`csvorg-import-topheading'.

HEADING-CONSTRUCTOR is a function which creates an entry heading
given as argument one parsed CSVFILE-row in list form. It defaults
to `csvorg-import-heading-constructor'.

COLNAMES is a list of column names. If it is nil, column names
are read from the first row of CSVFILE. Avoid COLNAMES in
`org-special-properties' if they are to be PROPCOLS, also if
their case differs.

PROPCOLS lists the names of columns to be inserted as
org-entry properties. SUBHCOLS lists the names of columns to
be inserted as org-entry subheadings. If neither is given,
PROPCOLS defaults to COLNAMES and SUBHCOLS to nil. If only one
of them is given, the other defaults to the remaining COLNAMES.

TRANSFORMS is a symbol for a list of functions used to transform
the field values. It defaults to `csvorg-import-transform-functions'.

CODING-SYSTEM is passed on to `pcsv-parse-file', which does the
parsing. If ^M occurs in output, try setting this to utf-8-dos."
